### Module 18 Challenge: Crypto Currencies: (Unsupervised Machine Learning)

# Challenge Overview:

The goal was to develop a machine learning model that would provide an understandable organization of the multitude of Crypto currencies into a manageable investment portfolio. The data provided was not standardized and needed to be clean-up before it could be used in a machine learning model. With the final output unknown “unsupervised learning” was determined to be better than the previously learn “supervised learning methods. Finally, we selected a clustering algorithm to group the crypto currencies with similar attributes and visualize the output.
Machine Learning Processes:

	PCA – the clean and standardize the data
  
	PCA – the remove unnecessary data dimensions
  
	K-Means method to determine optimal number of Clusters
  
	Visualize the final cluster output
